Support Laigter's development!
==============================

Economic Support
----------------

As a free and open source project, there are no incomes from the tool itself, beside the occasional optional payments from itch.io. Thats why, if you like Laigter, I ask you to consider contributing to the development in one of this ways!

- Chose to pay something when downloading the tool from the `project page <https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter/>`_,
- Become a `Patreon! <https://www.patreon.com/azagaya/>`_.
- Support me on `Kofi! <https://ko-fi.com/azagayavj/>`_.
- If you want other way to support my work, please feel free to contact me!
