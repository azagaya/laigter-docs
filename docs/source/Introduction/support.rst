Support Laigter's development!
==============================

Economic Support
----------------

As a free and open-source project, there are no incomes from the tool itself, besides the occasional optional payments from itch.io. That's why, if you like Laigter, I ask you to consider contributing to the development in one of these ways!

- Chose to pay something when downloading the tool from the `project page <https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter/>`_,
- Become a `Patreon! <https://www.patreon.com/azagaya/>`_.
- Support me on `Kofi! <https://ko-fi.com/azagayavj/>`_.
- If you want another way to support my work, please feel free to contact me!

Non economic Support
--------------------

Other things you may do to show your support, and help Laigter become more visible to the public, are:
