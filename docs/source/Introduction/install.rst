Installing Laigter
==================

Laigter is available for Linux, Windows, and MacOS. Mac version is experimental though, so expect some bugs!

Installing on Windows
---------------------

The only way currently to get an installer for windows, is trhough `itch.io <https://itch.io/>`_.

You can get the binaries directly from the `project page <https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter/>`_. There you can chose to download an installer, or a portable version if you prefer so. The instalation process is simple: just run the installer and follow the steps as with most software out there. With the portable version, you just need to extract the zip on a folder of your preference, and run the binary from there.

Note: due to Laigter being a free and open source tool with zero budget, it is not
registered on windows, so it may raise some alerts on the system. Please trust me,
it is totally safe to run Laigter.

Installing on Linux
-------------------

For Linux you have two options: *AppImage* or *flatpak*. The appimage is a self
contained executable, with all the needed libraries to run on most linux systems.
You can get it from  the `project page <https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter/>`_, or from
`github releases page <https://github.com/azagaya/laigter/releases/>`_. In that last page, you can even get the continuos build to test the latest changes on the development branch!

For running it, you just need to give corresponding persmissions, and double click on it. If you install `appimaged <https://github.com/AppImage/appimaged/>`_ it can be
even integrated to your desktop environment!

If you prefer to use *flatpak* instead, you can open your command line, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

   flatpak install flathub io.itch.azagaya.Laigter

You can get more information about this way to install on `flathub <https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.itch.azagaya.Laigter/>`_. After the install, the app should be
integrated into your desktop environment.

*Thanks a lot to `Calinou <https://github.com/Calinou/>`_ for this!*

Running on Mac
--------------

Laigter is provided as a zipped app in the `project page <https://azagaya.itch.io/laigter/>`_. Just download it and run it as your other apps.
